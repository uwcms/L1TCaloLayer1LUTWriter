#L1TCaloLayer1Spy

This package contains an unusual CMSSW producer, which uses TCP/IP
client to connect to the server running on CTP7 embedded linux systems
and creates raw data objects for input and output of CMS Level-1
Calorimeter Layer-1 System, i.e.,
  produces<HcalTrigPrimDigiCollection>();
  produces<EcalTrigPrimDigiCollection>();
  produces<CaloTowerBxCollection>();

When run on machines with P5 online environment it can obtain a contiguous
set of zerobias crossings being processed by the Layer-1 system.  These
are particularly useful for Layer-1 system monitoring and pileup level
determination.

Before using this package one needs to obtain the TCP/IP client software
using the online cactus SVN repository and install it somewhere.  Note 
that this depends on google protobuf-lite, which needs to have been 
installed on the build machine.

svn co svn+ssh://svn.cern.ch/reps/cactus/trunk/cactusprojects/calol1/extern/UCT2016Layer1CTP7Client UCT2016Layer1CTP7Client

For your convenience the client is currently installed on CERN AFS
in /afs/cern.ch/user/d/dasu/ and the directory trees are accessible 
to all system:anyuser.  So, you should be able to build whereever 
you have access to AFS with CERN tokens.
