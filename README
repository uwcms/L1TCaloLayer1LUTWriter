#L1TCaloLayer1Spy

This package contains an unusual CMSSW producer, which uses TCP/IP
client to connect to the server running on CTP7 embedded linux systems
and creates raw data objects for input and output of CMS Level-1
Calorimeter Layer-1 System, i.e.,
  produces<HcalTrigPrimDigiCollection>();
  produces<EcalTrigPrimDigiCollection>();
  produces<CaloTowerBxCollection>();

When run on machines with P5 online environment it can obtain a contiguous
set of zerobias crossings being processed by the Layer-1 system.  These
are particularly useful for Layer-1 system monitoring and pileup level
determination.

Before using this package one needs to obtain the TCP/IP client software
using the online cactus SVN repository and install it somewhere.  Note 
that this depends on google protobuf-lite, which needs to have been 
installed on the build machine.

svn co svn+ssh://svn.cern.ch/reps/cactus/trunk/cactusprojects/calol1/extern/UCT2016Layer1CTP7Client UCT2016Layer1CTP7Client

For your convenience the client is currently installed on CERN AFS
in /afs/cern.ch/user/d/dasu/public and the directory trees are 
accessible to all system:anyuser.  So, you should be able to build 
whereever you have access to AFS with CERN tokens.

Typically this package is run along with the emulator so that we
can make Spy digis to emulated digis comparison to validate the
Layer-1 hardware.  Check that out from L1Trigger/L1TCaloLayer1

To debug the Spy unpacker (testL1TCaloLayer1Spy.py) and emulator
(testL1TCaloLayer1EmulatorWithSpy.py), there are several options
for getting input.  You can use pre-captured files, pre-determined
patterns or ethernet captures.  You can run using the syntax:

cmsRun testL1TCaloLayer1EmulatorWithSpy.py setupString=patterns:DecreasingEM,IncreasingHD
cmsRun testL1TCaloLayer1EmulatorWithSpy.py setupString=patterns:ConstantEM=0xA7,DecreasingHD

etc.  The keywords IncreasingXX, DecreasingXX, ConstantXX, ConstantXX=0xAB 
where XX is EM or HD and 0xAB can be any byte-sized hex-number, can be
mixed to get various patterns.  Pattern string is case sensitive!

The syntax for pre-captured files is:

cmsRun testL1TCaloLayer1EmulatorWithSpy.py setupString=captures:/data/dasu/Layer1ZeroBiasCaptureData/r260490_2 maxEvents=162

The syntax for ethernet captures is:

cmsRun L1Trigger/L1TCaloLayer1/test/testL1TCaloLayer1EmulatorWithSpy.py setupString=ethernet:PhiMapFile.xml maxEvents=16200
where PhiMapFile.xml is path to an XML file specifying CTP7 card to TCP/IP address mapping.
